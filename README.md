It's built for real people: beginners who want simplicity and pros who need quick checks. With privacy as a top priority (all calcs happen locally), it's a trustworthy alternative to cloud-based services that might share your info.

### How the Tools Work: Step-by-Step Functionality
Using the site is intuitive, following a consistent workflow across all calculators:
1. **Select Your Tool**: From the homepage, click on the desired calculator (e.g., Payroll Tax for employer-side calcs).
2. **Input Your Data**: Enter required fields—things like gross pay, hours worked, filing status, deductions (e.g., health insurance, 401(k)), and location for state taxes. Inputs are straightforward text fields or dropdowns.
3. **Customize as Needed**: Add extras like dependents, additional income, or specific tax credits.
4. **Get Results Instantly**: As you type, JavaScript crunches the numbers, displaying:
   - Gross vs. Net Pay (for payroll).
   - Tax Breakdown (federal, state, local, FICA).
   - Explanations (e.g., "This includes 6.2% for Social Security").
   - Tips for accuracy (e.g., "Consult a tax pro for complex situations").

For the Payroll Tax Calculator specifically:
- **Inputs**: Employee salary/wage, pay frequency (weekly, bi-weekly), federal/state withholding rates, benefits deductions.
- **Outputs**: Total payroll taxes owed, employee net pay, employer contributions, and a pie chart or summary of splits.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles overtime, bonuses, or multi-state scenarios with adjustable parameters.

The interface is minimalistic: A header with the site title, a grid of calculator cards, and a footer with privacy notes. No clutter—just functional design that prioritizes usability.

### Technical Foundations
Built entirely with web fundamentals:
- **HTML**: Provides the semantic structure, including sections for calculators and input forms.
- **CSS**: Delivers the stylish, responsive visuals—think modern fonts, color-coded icons, and fluid layouts that scale seamlessly.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the core logic, performing calculations on-the-fly using browser APIs. This enables the privacy feature by avoiding server calls.

Hosted on GitHub Pages, it's lightweight (quick loads even on slow connections) and open for contributions if you're into forking the repo.
